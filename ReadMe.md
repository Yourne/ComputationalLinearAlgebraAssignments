# Computational Linear Algebra Assignments
This repository contains some of the homework assignments I completed for the course *Computational Linear Algebra for Large-Scale Problems*, which was taught by Professor S. Berrone in late 2021 at Politecnico di Torino. I have uploaded these assignments for my own future reference.

The first assignment involves the implementation of a k-Nearest Neighbor clustering algorithm in MATLAB, applied to samples projected onto their eigenspace.

The second assignment compares the Householder reflection method with the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization method, used to solve the least squares problem, with a focus on the sensitivity of the solutions.
